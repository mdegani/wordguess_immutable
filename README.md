# wordguess_immutable
Try this game on an iPad with a child that is learning the alphabet.  Click "new game" (top left corner) and type a word.  When the word is revealed it will be rainbow-coloured - click the word to change the colours.  Feedback welcome.

I created this app to experiment with the Immutable.js library and to entertain my 2 1/2 year old daughter.
